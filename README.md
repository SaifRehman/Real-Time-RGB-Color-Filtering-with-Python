# Real-Time RGB color filtering with Python

## Prerequisites
- opencv2
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage

``python run.py``

## Description
This script is specially designed to filter out a range of colors in real time. It can also filter out the noise by erosion and dilation techniques. Also, it can detect different colored uniform shapes in real time, for now it is a simple triangle. Algorithmns that were used in this script were Canny Edge detection and Hough transform.
Enjoy the project. Ps: This was made for my software engineering project.
